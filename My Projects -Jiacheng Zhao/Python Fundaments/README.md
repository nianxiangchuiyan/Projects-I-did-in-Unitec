I studied python in my first semester learning Computing which didn't provide good Project.
But I am learning Django this semester, to practice it I am trying to do a dice game with it. the dice game is a minigame in Kingdom Come delivernace 2, and I am trying to copy the game so I can enjoy it any time.
this game is not finished yet. I am nearly finished on cmd demo and I posted it here.
