I studied 2 diffierent courses with C#, I pick one project I did for each of them. both of them are games,
First game is Black Jack, this game was made for data structure course and I can practice stack and queue with it
The seconed game is Brick Out, this game was made for GUI programming the gui interactions were very cool.

Both game application are runable in any PC with C# installed
